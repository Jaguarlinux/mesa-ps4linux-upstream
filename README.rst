Source

This repository lives at https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa.
Other repositories are likely forks, and code found there is not supported.


Build & install
---------------

You can find more information in our documentation (`docs/install.rst
<https://docs.mesa3d.org/install.html>`_), but the recommended way is to use
Meson (`docs/meson.rst <https://docs.mesa3d.org/meson.html>`_):

.. code-block:: sh

  $ chmod +x buildmesa32.sh buildmesa64.sh
  $ ./buildmesa64.sh
  $ ./buildmesa32.sh

Support
-------

Many Mesa devs hang on IRC; if you're not sure which channel is
appropriate, you should ask your question on `OFTC's #dri-devel
<irc://irc.oftc.net/dri-devel>`_, someone will redirect you if
necessary.
Remember that not everyone is in the same timezone as you, so it might
take a while before someone qualified sees your question.
To figure out who you're talking to, or which nick to ping for your
question, check out `Who's Who on IRC
<https://dri.freedesktop.org/wiki/WhosWho/>`_.

The next best option is to ask your question in an email to the
mailing lists: `mesa-dev\@lists.freedesktop.org
<https://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/mesa-dev>`_
